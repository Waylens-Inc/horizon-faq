###How to update firmware

As we continue to develop and update our camera’s capabilities, it is important to keep your software and firmware up to date. To make sure you are using the latest firmware, please follow the steps below:

For iOS users:

1. Connect your phone to your camera’s hotspot, or have both your phone and camera connected to the same wifi network as clients.

2. Open Waylens App and connect it to your camera, if there is a new firmware version available, the App will pop up a dialog. Click “OK” to continue.

For Android:

1. Most Android devices don’t allow using the 4G network while connecting to a hotspot, thus when your phone is connecting to the camera via its hotspot, the firmware update warning won’t show up. The only way to update your firmware is connecting your phone and camera to the same wifi network as clients.

2. Open Waylens App and connect it to your camera, if there is a new firmware version available, the App will pop up a dialog. Click “OK” to continue.
