###What does “Card Error” mean and how to avoid it?

Generally speaking, higher video quality means higher instant writing speed into the SD card ( for instance, 40Mbps for 1080p60 and 720p120; 20Mbps for 1080p30 and 720p60; 12Mbps for 720p30), and faster recycling of the memory during the loop recording as well. That is why we recommended a class 10, 32GB/64GB/128GB endurable SD card.

The “Card Error” usually means there are some bad blocks in the card and it cannot write data at the required speed.

However, the “Card Error” doesn’t necessarily mean your card is bad. It just indicate that the card is not available to write data at a very high speed steadily.

If you want to reuse the same card, try formatting it from the camera settings — storage — format(you maywant to back up your video contents to the PC before doing that) and recording with a lower video quality such as 720p30.

To avoid or reduce the occurrence of “Card Error”, here are some suggestions:

1. Use SD cards that are validated by our engineers, or good ones from below links.

2. Use SD cards with large capacity(>=32GB). As we said, the loop recording recycles the buffered video space in the card to store the latest footage, large capacity means less cycle index of the whole card, which eventually prolong the card’s working time.

3. Back up your highlights to PC as often as you need so that you can delete them from your card, since they won’t be recycled, meaning when there are too many highlights in your card you only get very little space for recycling.
